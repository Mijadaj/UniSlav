## Features

- Allows typing most of the characters used in Slavic languages, including Cyrillic, Latin, and Glagolitic scripts.
- Created with [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), making it easily customizable.

**Note:**
The developer usually uses a 106/109 Japanese keyboard and has developed this AHK script accordingly, so it may not be directly applicable to keyboards for other languages.
In that case, please adjust the hotkeys as needed.
In particular, note that `sc07B` (the *muhenkan* 無変換 key) is used as a modifier key.
