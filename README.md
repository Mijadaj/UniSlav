## Slavic-keyboard

- Written in [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), for Windows only.
- Enables to type most of the characters used in **Slavic languages**, including both Latin and Cyrillic scripts.

---

Since I typically use a Japanese (108-key) keyboard layout, this AHK script may not be immediately adaptable to keyboards in other countries.
Please adjust the HotKeys to match your own layout. Note that the［無変換］(sc07B) key is primarily used as a modifier, which does not work on other keyboards.

## Usage

1. Run `src\KeyboardControls.ahk`.  
1. Each keyboard is activated/terminated with the following HotKeys.
    - `Ctrl + 1`  
    activates (terminates) keyboards in the following order: Modern Cyrillic → Latin script → Early Cyrillic
    - `Shift + 1`  
    Glagolitic keyboard
